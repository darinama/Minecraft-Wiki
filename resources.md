# Natural resources
- dirt

Dirt is the most basic block in Minecraft, and it covers most biomes. As a new player, it is important to gather some dirt because it is always useful.
Dirt is often used at the beginning of a save to create a temporary base to survive through the first few couple of nights.
Dirt cannot be used to craft tools, but it is essential to farming. Crops can only grow on tilled dirt or glass blocks.
Moreover, having a stack of dirt blocks in your inventory might always be helpful, whether it is to build a temporary base, block yourself from dangerous mobs, or easily climb levels.
  
- wood

Wood is a fundamental resource in Minecraft. It is the first resource you should look for because it is essential to gather almost all of the other resources.
Wood is obtained by chopping down a tree, which can be done barehand but will be faster if the player uses an axe.
There are different types of trees, which can be found in different biomes. The most common are oak and birch trees.
Wood is used to craft planks, a very basic item. Planks are used to craft a large number of things, including sticks which are used to craft all of the essential tools such as pickaxes, axes, hoes, swords, and shovels.
Wood can be burned in an oven to create charcoal.
