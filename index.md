This website is a beginner guide to the video game *Minecraft*. From crafting to *The End*, find out the basics of Minecraft and how to survive in a hostile survival game!

Minecraft is a sandbox videogame released in 2011 and developed by Mojang. It is a 3D videogame defined by its "block-ish" appearance since everything is a block or square-ish.

The two main modes of the game are Survival and Creative.
The **Creative** mode allows you to access all of the resources infinitely from your inventory and build and do anything you want. It is usually used by players to build small or big structures.

The **Survival** mode allows you to play as an individual, where hostile creatures will try to kill you while you try to survive by gathering resources before beating the final boss of the videogame. In this mode, you have a certain number of hearts representing your health, which can decrease if you take damage or are poisoned. You must satisfy your hunger to regain health.

As the game title indicates, Minecraft is about mining and crafting. The only "story goal" is to kill the Ender Dragon, ~~if you dare to.~~
