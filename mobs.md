Mobs are living creatures who roam the world and with whom the player can impact.

There are three main types of mobs in Minecraft: passive mobs, neutral mobs and hostile mobs.

# Passive mobs
Passive mobs don't attack the player, even if the player attacks them.
Animals will drop food, which the player can cook and eat.
The most common passive mobs that a player will encounter are:

## Pigs

Sheep are common mobs that spawn in plains, forests, taiga, and mountain biomes.
Sheep drop raw mutton, which can be cooked, and wool. Wool can be obtained without harming a sheep using shears. Wool can be used to craft beds, carpets, and other decorative objects. Wool and sheep can be dyed in a large palette of colors but colored sheep can spawn, such as black sheep, brown sheep, or even pink sheep. Sheep can be bred using wheat.

## Horses

Horses are common mobs that spawn in plains and savanna biomes.
They come in various colors and patterns. Horses can be bred using golden apples or golden carrots.
A horse can be tamed and ridden by the player, to travel faster. A saddle is required for the horse to be controlled while riding. Saddles can be found in chests around the overworld or traded with villagers. An armor can also be equipped on the horse.
Horses drop leather. 

## Chickens

Chickens are common mobs that spawn in plains, forests, and swamps.
They can lay eggs, which the player can use in recipes such as cakes, or thrown to potentially spawn a baby chick. Chickens can be bred using seeds.
Chickens drop raw chicken and feathers.

Other passive mobs a player can encounter are cats, donkeys, squids, various types of fish or even parrots.

## Villagers

</p>

In Minecraft, various types of villagers can be found in villages. They can have different professions such as armorers, clerics, or shepherds but the most important and useful ones to the player are farmers, librarians, and blacksmiths. 

Their profession can be identified thanks to their specific clothing. A player can assign an unemployed villager to a profession by placing a job site block near them. For example, for a villager to become a librarian, a lectern needs to be placed near them.

The player can breed villagers by feeding them bread, and the grown adult will automatically be an unemployed villager. But each villager needs its own bed and food nearby.

The player can trade with villagers using emeralds, and gain useful resources such as enchantment books, enchanted tools or armor, or rare resources.

# Neutral mobs
Neutral mobs won't attack the player but will fight back if they are attacked.

## Bees

Bees spawn near flower-filled places.
They live in hives or nests and honey and honeycombs can be harvested using shears or bottles. Bees will attack the player if a bee is harmed, honey or honeycomb is collected without a campfire placed under, or if a nest is destroyed. Brees can be bred using flowers.

## Spiders
