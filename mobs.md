Mobs are living creatures who roam the world freely.
There are three main types of mobs in Minecraft: passive mobs, neutral mobs, and hostile mobs.
Most mobs will drop loot when killed, which can be used to craft other things.

</p>

In Minecraft, various types of villagers can be found in villages. They can have different professions such as armorers, clerics, or shepherds but the most important and useful ones to the player are farmers, librarians, and blacksmiths. 

Their profession can be identified thanks to their clothing. You can assign an unemployed villager to a profession by placing a job site block near them. For example, for a villager to become a librarian, a lectern needs to be placed near them.

The player can breed villagers by feeding them bread, and the grown adult will automatically become an unemployed villager. But each villager needs a bed and food nearby.

The player can trade with villagers using emeralds, and gain useful resources such as enchantment books, enchanted tools, or armor.
